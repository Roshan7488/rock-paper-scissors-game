#  Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is an interactive Rock Paper Scissors game built using JavaScript.  
I created this project while learning JavaScript and kept improving it as I progressed in my course.

This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, event listeners, arrow functions, and browser storage.

## Learning Purpose
